Input data for the `immunomatch_cancer.R` script
* `immunomatch_scored_data.RData`: .RData file containing ImmunoMatch results and some sequence information from IgBlast (for the leukaemia/lymphoma curated sequences)
* `King_Tonsil_GC_paired.csv`: Paired VH-VL sequences from GC B cells in the King et al. tonsil dataset.
* `ccle_celllines_filtered_mixcr_results_videntity.csv`: Paired VH-VL sequences from lymphoma/leukaemia cell lines from the CCLE RNA-seq data. VH and VL sequences were stitched back togetheer using MiXCR (see Methods section of the ImmunoMatch paper for more details).
* `cll_sequence_aa_with_info.txt`: Collection of CLL VH and VL sequences curated from GenBank.
* `immunomatch_scored_datasets_cancers.csv`: Curated leukaemia/lymphoma VH-VL sequence annotation by their cancer subtypes (This was done manually via referring to original publications etc.).
* `lymphoma_sequence_aa_with_info.txt`: Collection of B-cell lymphoma VH and VL sequences curated from GenBank.
